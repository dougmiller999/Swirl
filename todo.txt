PRIORITIES LIST
-----------------
[] inflowing wall and a drain on the bottom,
[] restart capability, which is also a way to put in an approximate
   guess to start with (cut way down on iterations needed).
[] angled walls so we can try a funnel
[] some way to test all that for correctness.
[] convergence study 
[] Convert to Jax
[] Make it go in parallel!
[] profile for speed
-----------------
DONE
[25/09/05] successfully run rotating bucket, slow omega (floor covered)
[25/09/04] successfully run rotating bucket, fast omega (air core)
[25/09/03] pass hydrostatic gravity test
[25/09/03] use Poisson pressure projection to solve N-S incompressible
           (P,ur,ut,uz) system in Python.

## Where we are today, FRI September  5, 2025 (we are 4 days in).


We have a 2DRZ steady state incompressible Navier-Stokes solver that
is producing results that compare well on solid-body-rotation analytic
solutions for the "rotating bucket" problem at two different rotation
speeds (one high enough to produce an air core in the middle, one low
enough that the floor of the bucket is covered with liquid).
